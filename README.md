# Tetris Game

A classic Tetris game built with TypeScript and Vite.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. This will also install `npm` (Node Package Manager), which is used to manage the project's dependencies.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Open your terminal** in the root directory of the project (where the `package.json` file is located).

2.  **Install the dependencies.** This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the necessary tools (like Vite) that the project needs to run. You only need to do this once.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Game

1.  **Start the development server.** This will launch the game in your default web browser.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Preview on a mobile device.** To test the game on your phone, run this command instead. It will give you a "Network" URL that you can open in your phone's browser (make sure your computer and phone are on the same Wi-Fi network).

    ```bash
    npm run preview:mobile
    ```
