### How to Add Sound Effects

The game's sound engine is fully implemented. To enable sounds, you need to add your own `.wav` or `.mp3` files to the correct folder.

**Due to the build process (Vite), all public assets like sounds MUST be placed in a `public` folder.**

1.  **Create a `public` folder:** In the root directory of your project (the same level as `index.html`), create a new folder named `public`.
2.  **Create a `sounds` folder:** Inside the new `public` folder, create a folder named `sounds`.
3.  **Add your audio files:** Place your sound files inside this new `public/sounds/` folder. The game code will automatically look for files with these **exact names**:
    *   `move.wav` (for moving left/right)
    *   `rotate.wav` (for rotating a piece)
    *   `softDrop.wav` (for pressing down arrow)
    *   `hardDrop.wav` (for pressing spacebar)
    *   `lock.wav` (when a piece solidifies)
    *   `hold.wav` (for using the hold queue)
    *   `clearLine.wav` (for clearing 1-3 lines)
    *   `clearTetris.wav` (for clearing 4 lines)
    *   `levelUp.wav` (when the level increases)
    *   `pause.wav` (when the game is paused)
    *   `gameOver.wav` (when the game ends)

The game will now find and play your sounds automatically. No further code changes are needed.
